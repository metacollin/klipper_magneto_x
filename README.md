Welcome to the Magneto X Klipper Firmware Project! This repository is a dedicated fork from the original [Klipper repository](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper), tailored specifically for the Magneto X 3D printer.

## Klipper Firmware for Magneto X
Klipper is an advanced 3D printer firmware that leverages the computing power of a general-purpose computer in conjunction with one or more micro-controllers to achieve superior printing performance. By offloading much of the heavy lifting to a more capable processor, Klipper can drive your Magneto X with unparalleled precision and speed.

The Magneto X, with its state-of-the-art MagXY magnetic levitation linear motor system and the innovative Lancer extruder, represents a leap forward in desktop 3D printing technology. Designed to deliver exceptional print quality at high speeds, the Magneto X benefits greatly from Klipper's efficient processing and movement algorithms. This firmware project aims to unlock the full potential of the Magneto X, enhancing its capabilities beyond the conventional limits of desktop 3D printing.
